// The file "Final Report.pdf" is a 28 page research report explaining all of the code in depth within this project. That report breaks down all of the code snippet by snippet and explains what all of it does. This was my capstone project during my last semester at Northeastern State University (2019) in which I give equal credit to my partner Ayoko Toluwanimi as well. The main part of the code is within the files named "PC_Servo_Multi.ino" and "Form1.cs".
